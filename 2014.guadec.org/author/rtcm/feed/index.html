				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GUADEC is the annual conference of the GNOME community, held in Europe since 2000. GUADEC is the world&#8217;s largest gathering of users and developers who are involved with the free desktop and mobile user interfaces. GUADEC 2013 will be held in Brno, Czech Republic, a city which has played host to several other successful GNOME-related hackfests in the past. GUADEC is expected to draw hundreds of attendees who will discuss and direct the future of the GNOME project. Developers, artists, translators, users, and representatives from government, education, and businesses, and anyone else who shares an interest are welcome to attend. And we need you to give a talk!<br />
<span id="more-572"></span></p>
<h3>The schedule of the conference mirrors the ongoing development of the GNOME project:</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Design of the core user experience (core applications, shell, toolkit)</li>
<li>Design of the developer experience (tools, documentation, services)</li>
<li>Integration and extension of the operating system plumbings into the core UX</li>
<li>Application development and deployment</li>
<li>Integration of web technologies into the GNOME user experience</li>
<li>Improving the user experience on different form factors</li>
<li>Outreach to new contributors</li>
<li>Organization and governance of the project</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>Submissions that do not fit into these categories are also welcome, provided that they are relevant or inspirational to the GNOME community. The deadline to submit talks is April 27th.</p>
