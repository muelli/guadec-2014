				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #444444;">Although most of the Wayland porting work will be solved by UI toolkits like GTK+, when X dependencies go beyond an implementation detail and have an influence on how a particular feature was designed, porting the software to Wayland can be more challenging. WebKit2GTK+ is one such case due to the split process architecture that comes with WebKit2, where rendering happens across two processes that need optimal (zero-copy) mechanisms to share an accelerated graphics surface for its Accelerated Compositing feature. This talk is intended for developers interested in porting applications to Wayland that need to share accelerated graphics between two processes. The talk will focus on WebKit2GTK+ as a case study, explaining how WebKit2&#8217;s architecture and X influenced the original design and implementation of Accelerated Compositing and how this feature is redesigned and implemented for Wayland.</span></p>

In contrast, the PyGObject bindings are extremely capable, and the popularity of Python in scientific and engineering fields has been growing.</span></p>
<p>In this talk I will highlight some of the strengths of python including</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #444444;"> Its integration with existing best-of-class frameworks (Robot Operating System, OpenCV, Machine learning/scikit-learn)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #444444;">Many options for integrating with native code</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #444444;"> The IPython web notebook development environment and the use of Python as a teaching tool</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #444444;"> I intend to propose that through embracing python, and with a few small changes of strategy, that the GNOME platform could be a valuable member of the scientific ecosystem.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A<span style="color: #444444;">t GUADEC 2013 I presented a talk about designing the future canvas API inside GTK+, and how we could learn from the lessons of Clutter as well as from other platforms like the Web.</p>
<p>After a year spent implementing that design, I will explain what I did, what I had to learn, and what I had to change of that original vision, as well as showing what the future of the GNOME core tool kit will look like.</p>
<p>Unlike the talks from previous years, this talk will not feature: memes, ponies, or rainbows. it will feature data structures for 3D math, layers, and the occasional topical reference to the pop culture fad of this summer. there will be screen shots, and possibly live demos.</span></p>
