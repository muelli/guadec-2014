				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #444444;">Input methods are an important part of a desktop because writing text is one of the most important daily activities of any user.</span></p>
<p>The talk will focus on evolution/history of input frameworks and the future towards Wayland integration with GNOME.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will introduce a new library which provides a minimal core functions of input method frameworks. In general, input method frameworks with long history have many portability hacks to provide consistent user experience under different environments (X11, GTK+, Qt, etc.). The minial core library could make it easier to port input methods to new platform, like Wayland.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will talk about integration of text prediction features into input methods and desktop as a whole. Most of the input methods provides API&#8217;s for text prediction and spell checking, so this talk would explain how we can improve text prediction and spell checking so that users will get native text prediction experience.</p>

<p>Outreach both internal and external is about defending our story and not allowing others to write it for us. Let&#8217;s talk about how we can better present ourselves to the public in the age of social media and reduce the conflict that we have while continuing to pursue our goal of being a competitive desktop based on Free Software and our mission to spread Free Software.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #444444;">We seldom know exactly why one release of GNOME is faster or slower than the last. We have various tests we can run to measure performance, but comparing results for one release with results from a previous release provides less clarity than one might hope. Even if hardware is exactly the same, there are many elements in the software stack &#8211; from the kernel, to the graphics drivers, to the toolkits, to the application itself, that can produce performance changes. From one release of GNOME to the next, each of these layers sees hundreds or thousands of changes.</span></p>
<p>It is much more useful if we can get performance numbers continuously as changes go into the codebase. We will then have a better chance of identifying a change that slows down GNOME or verifying whether if a change that was supposed to improve performance actually did. We already have a system that does continuous builds of GNOME and runs basic tests on them: GNOME Continuous. The tests that GNOME Continuous runs are, however, run on virtual machines, which poses multiple challenges for performance testing &#8211; in particular, lack of accelerated graphics, and interference from other use of the same system.</p>
<p>This talk will describe the new GNOME Hardware Testing initiative, which has a goal to take the builds of GNOME and base system software that GNOME Continuous creates, measure the performance on a range of performance tests, record the results, and make charts and graphs of that data available to developers. The talk will discuss technology used: how ostree is used to distribute software to the testing systems, and how upgrading, rebooting, and testing is automated to eliminate any need for manual intervention, while still allowing stock commodity hardware to be tested. It will also cover the selection of appropriate tests to reflect the performance of GNOME in a comprehensible way.</p>

His current interests relate to display technologies and the full-stack performance of GNOME.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #444444;">When we think about the user experience that GNOME provides, we usually focus on implementation and design. It is these factors that are thought to affect the quality of the experience that we provide. However, social factors also play a major role in determining the quality of our software: modules need a sufficient number of contributors, and they need to be organised so that modules can move forward and keep on top of bugs.</span></p>
<p>In this talk, I&#8217;m going to discuss how the social dimension of the GNOME project affects the quality of our software. I will outline some issues with the current situation, and will propose some ideas and initiatives that can help us address them. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate that we need to work on the social as well as the technical aspect of GNOME if we want to improve the quality of our user experience.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s core functionality provides the tools neccessary to create configuration profiles through a web interface and deploy those profiles upon users, groups or hosts. Moving forward it intends to provide extended funcionality such as lockdown settings to prevent users from accessing certain apps, adding bookmarks to the web browser or deploy online accounts automagically.</p>
