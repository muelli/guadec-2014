				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #444444;">Input methods are an important part of a desktop because writing text is one of the most important daily activities of any user.</span></p>
<p>The talk will focus on evolution/history of input frameworks and the future towards Wayland integration with GNOME.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will introduce a new library which provides a minimal core functions of input method frameworks. In general, input method frameworks with long history have many portability hacks to provide consistent user experience under different environments (X11, GTK+, Qt, etc.). The minial core library could make it easier to port input methods to new platform, like Wayland.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will talk about integration of text prediction features into input methods and desktop as a whole. Most of the input methods provides API&#8217;s for text prediction and spell checking, so this talk would explain how we can improve text prediction and spell checking so that users will get native text prediction experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #444444;">Although most of the Wayland porting work will be solved by UI toolkits like GTK+, when X dependencies go beyond an implementation detail and have an influence on how a particular feature was designed, porting the software to Wayland can be more challenging. WebKit2GTK+ is one such case due to the split process architecture that comes with WebKit2, where rendering happens across two processes that need optimal (zero-copy) mechanisms to share an accelerated graphics surface for its Accelerated Compositing feature. This talk is intended for developers interested in porting applications to Wayland that need to share accelerated graphics between two processes. The talk will focus on WebKit2GTK+ as a case study, explaining how WebKit2&#8217;s architecture and X influenced the original design and implementation of Accelerated Compositing and how this feature is redesigned and implemented for Wayland.</span></p>

<p>In this talk I will highlight some of the strengths of python including</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #444444;"> Its integration with existing best-of-class frameworks (Robot Operating System, OpenCV, Machine learning/scikit-learn)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #444444;">Many options for integrating with native code</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #444444;"> The IPython web notebook development environment and the use of Python as a teaching tool</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #444444;"> I intend to propose that through embracing python, and with a few small changes of strategy, that the GNOME platform could be a valuable member of the scientific ecosystem.</span></p>
